# Blender .glb Viewer

Model Loading:
The .glb file format was used for its compact size and efficient loading of 3D models. The model was loaded into the webpage using three.js, a powerful JavaScript library for rendering 3D content.

Interactivity:
Users could rotate, zoom, and pan the 3D model using mouse controls or touch gestures.
Real-time lighting adjustments and material properties added depth to the presentation.

Web Design:
A clean and professional layout was implemented using CSS, ensuring that the 3D viewer seamlessly blended with the rest of the webpage.
Additional UI elements, like buttons to reset the model's position or toggle animation, were styled for consistency.
Optimized Performance:

Lazy loading and optimized textures were used to ensure smooth performance on various devices, including mobile and desktop.
